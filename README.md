# C# Basics Learning Journey

## Overview

This repository contains my personal journey and learning path as I dive into the basics of C#. The goal of this project is to document the key concepts, coding exercises, and projects I’ve completed as part of my learning experience. By exploring various fundamental aspects of C#, I aim to solidify my understanding of the language and build a strong foundation for more advanced topics.

## Topics Covered

Throughout this journey, I’ve explored the following concepts:

1. **Introduction to .NET and C#**  
   An introduction to the C# language and its core structure, including setting up projects and solutions in the .NET environment.

2. **Variables and Data Types**  
   Understanding primitive data types, variable declarations, and their uses in C#.

3. **Boolean Types and Control Structures**  
   Learning how to work with boolean expressions, and using if-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while), and basic decision-making processes.

4. **Arrays**  
   Mastering the creation and manipulation of single and multi-dimensional arrays for data storage and retrieval.

5. **Expressions and Type Casting**  
   Working with arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions, as well as converting between data types through explicit and implicit casting.

6. **Fields, Constants, and Methods**  
   Deep diving into declaring fields, using constants, and implementing methods to organize and reuse code effectively.

7. **Constructors**  
   Learning about constructors and their role in initializing objects within C#.

8. **Properties and Indexers**  
   Understanding how properties encapsulate class fields and how indexers provide access to elements in a class using index notation.

9. **Delegates** *(currently learning)*  
   Working on understanding how delegates work, which is a key aspect of functional programming in C#. This topic involves learning how to pass methods as parameters, creating anonymous functions, and exploring events.

## Learning Approach

My learning approach is a mix of theory and practice. I cover each topic step by step, starting with a theoretical understanding of concepts and reinforcing that knowledge by implementing small projects and coding exercises.

## Challenges and Projects

I will also include projects and coding challenges related to the topics I've learned to further deepen my understanding. These include small applications, algorithm-based exercises, and hands-on examples demonstrating the use of C# fundamentals.

## Next Steps

After mastering the basics, I plan to explore more advanced topics like:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- LINQ and Collections
- Asynchronous Programming
- Exception Handling

## Conclusion

This repository is a reflection of my ongoing progress in learning C#. It will be updated as I continue to dive deeper into more complex areas of the language. Any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to improve this journey are welcome!
